Hello,

You have received my Double Pendulum simulator.
This grafical program is a showcase of strange chaotic behaviour of double pendulum. 
Root file is "main.py" which contains main function call.
After running "main.py" you will enter fullscreen GUI.
In the app you can change weights of individual joins as well as drag coeficient that will the pendulum experience. You can also move joints into different possitions using cursor.
You can start of simulation using button "Start" which afterwards changes to "Pause" so you can pause/unpause (once paused button changes to "Unpause") the sim at any moment. 
If you want to stop/reset you can use reset button which will load all the default values and positions back.

PS: You can encounter funky behaviour with specific edge cases as there are just way too many combinations of positions and weights where calculation step might not be sufficient.
